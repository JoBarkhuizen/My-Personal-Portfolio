    <h2>My Objective:</h2>
    <p>I am a diligent test analyst with 11 years’ experience in the IT industry.  I have experience in customer service and these skills have
         earned me employee awards in two organisations. I recently started studying responsive web development and will finish with my last 
         project before the end of August 2019.</p>

    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>Experienced test analyst, returning to Information Technology market after assisting my husband in his business.  Knowledge of 
            development life-cycle and attention to detail.   Competent to manage time effectively and prioritise tasks in line with the
             business.  I see myself as the right hand of any development team and not just as the “error finder”.  I believe the skills
              that I picked up as a customer service manager helped me tremendously.  I realize the success of any project is one’s ability
               to not just perform on a technical aspect but also on people skills.</p>

<h2>Personal Skills</h2>
<h4>Team work</h4>
<p>As a manager I never just delegated job funtions, I got involved with my team to ensure all work is done on time and without any major problems.</p>
<h4>Willingness to learn:</h4>
<p>When the need arose at iGrade to load all the company data on the SAP ERP system, I got a 3-day crash course and got the job done.</p>
<h4>Leadership:</h4>
<p>A great leader is someone that adapts to every project and empowers their team to succeed, this knowledge I gained through years of working in diverse fields.</p>
<h4>Customer Service:</h4>
<p>By ensuring customer satisfaction with the service you provided.</p>
